# ML-Flight-Fare-Prediction
In this notebook, I have made an attempt to develop a model to solve the Kaggle Problem Statement - Flight Fare Prediction using ML Regression. Here, I have implemented various ML regression models and finally decided upon Random Forest Regressor for predictions.

What I do in this project
    a) Data collection from Kaggle
    b) Perform Data Cleaning / Data Preparation / Data Pre-processing
    c) Data visuaslisation(EDA)
    d) Perform feature engineering
        I)  Feature encoding
        II) checking outliers & impute it..

    e) build machine leaning model & dump it..

Flight Fare Prediction using ML Regression 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

â€¢ The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle, and it is a time-stamped
dataset so, while building the model, extensive pre-processing was done on
the dataset especially on the date-time columns to finally come up with a ML
model which could effectively predict airline fares across various Indian Cities

 Life Cycle of any ML Project! 

 0. Problem Solving 
 a) North Star Metrics (define success)
 b) Build a rough sketch for the problem

 1. Data Collection 
 a) Frame the requirement
 b) Define quantity & quality

 2. EDA
 a) Data Cleaning 
 b) Data QC 
 c) Feature Engg
 3. Data Selection
 a) Split (Train Vs Test Vs Val)
 b) Random/ Stratified 
 4. Pre - Processing 
 5. Train the model
 a) Baseline model
 b) Now build on top (hyper parameter)
 c) Record your metrics 
 d) Save the model
 6. Validation  
 7. Testing
 8. Inferencing 
 a) Build a system that will help the other application to use model
